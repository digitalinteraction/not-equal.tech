  text: In 2019, Britain’s gig economy doubled over three years accounting for 4.7
    million workers. However, these digital platforms have created a precarious nature
    of employment with working people struggling to make ends meet. Switch-Gig explored
    how to centre the voices and experiences of gig workers in the re-design of gig
    economy platforms. The project team ran workshops for couriers discussing their
    experiences of technology.

  text: Through speculative fiction, the groups came up with ideas to create a Switch
    Gig design booklet. The main themes were couriers’ role as “local heroes” and
    essential “key workers”; couriers as infrastructure; couriers’ livelihoods at
    the whim of opaque unknowable systems; couriers seizing power and working together
    to share knowledge; and couriers as deviants – obliged to appropriate and subvert
    the infrastructure of the city to make a living.

  text: These themes were discussed with industrial partners to understand their perspective
    and how it relates to their understanding of courier issues. The feedback demonstrated
    how the perspectives of technologists and couriers on the same issues can differ
    greatly. This pilot project will inform larger-scale projects to support the needs
    of, and address the issues faced by, gig-workers, both in the UK and abroad.
