  text: 'The project set out to address entrenched inequalities in the cultural sector
    and work towards social justice for workers in a precarious economy. The project
    ran a series of six research workshops entitled Assembly: A Forum for Artists
    in Precarious Labour hosted by, and produced in collaboration with, Newbridge
    Project, an artist-led community centre. Around 50 participants attended the workshops.'

  text: A key concern among participants was their lack of knowledge concerning key
    practical information, especially relating to employment law, rights, contracts,
    invoicing and other administrative activities associated with working as a freelancer
    in the digital cultural sector.

  text: The taboo of conversations around finances and working conditions was considered
    a major barrier to progression on issues of precarity within the sector and barriers
    to solidarity amongst workers in a sector dominated by freelancing, low pay and
    undercutting were outlined. This was considered a cultural phenomenon linked to
    long-standing assumptions regarding creativity and individualism. There are plans
    to host a physical resource hub with the Newbridge Project and the Star and Shadow
    Cinema and the establishment of the digital resource hub will follow.
