  text: Older adults are targeted by internet scammers due to their lower digital
    literacy and limited computer support network. This project worked with 14 older
    adults to train them to share reliable cybersecurity information with their peers
    to help prevent opportunistic cyber-attacks. The CyberGuardians received training
    looking at different aspects of cybersecurity including live demonstrations of
    password hacking, and a phishing test. The topics focused on issues the group
    identified, such as password management, scam detection and protective software.

  text: The CyberGuardians went on to disseminate cybersecurity information to around
    820 people through peer-to-peer learning over the course of nine months. When
    Covid-19 hit, the CyberGuardians moved online and helped many older citizens to
    stay safe during the phishing increase and gave advice on using Zoom securely
    so they could stay in touch with family and friends.

    The research team is looking into ways of expanding the scheme to other older demographics, such as those dealing with loneliness and isolation.
