  text: Knife crime offences in England and Wales have hit a record high; with most
    incidents in London involving young people 10-25 years old. The project’s aim
    was to create a technology-based mechanism to enable the collection of data to
    understand the experiences and contexts of knife crime and thereby open up dialogue
    with local institutions in order to co-create potential responses. The project
    first sought to understand and compare police officials’ and young people’s perceptions
    about knife crime, and trust in policing in Hackney. This understanding was used
    to design the ‘Fear of Crime App’.

  text: The project team interviewed 23 young people and police experts. 50 young
    people were involved as co-researchers and used the app to interview their peers
    and capture additional data. Young people identified stop and search activities
    as having a strong racial bias, and as “unfair and abusive” leading to their complete
    lack of trust in policing. They were aware of the police’s enforcement-based activities
    but unaware of community-building approaches so it feels important to make young
    people aware of non-enforcement activities, as a means to foster trust and engagement.
    The project team intends to meet with the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime
    (MOPAC) to discuss how the findings can be implemented London-wide with the Metropolitan
    Police.
