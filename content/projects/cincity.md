    text: The project team interviewed 23 young people and police experts. 50 young
      people were involved as co-researchers and used the app to interview their
      peers and capture additional data. Young people identified stop and search
      activities as having a strong racial bias, and as “unfair and abusive”
      leading to their complete lack of trust in policing. They were aware of
      the police’s enforcement-based activities but unaware of
      community-building approaches so it feels important to make young people
      aware of non-enforcement activities, as a means to foster trust and
      engagement. The project team intends to meet with the Mayor’s Office for
      Policing and Crime (MOPAC) to discuss how the findings can be implemented
      London-wide with the Metropolitan Police.

Knife crime offences in England and Wales have hit a record high; with most incidents in London involving young people 10-25 years old. The project’s aim was to create a technology-based mechanism to enable the collection of data to understand the experiences and contexts of knife crime and thereby open up dialogue with local institutions in order to co-create potential responses. The project first sought to understand and compare police officials’ and young people’s perceptions about knife crime, and trust in policing in Hackney. This understanding was used to design the ‘Fear of Crime App’.
