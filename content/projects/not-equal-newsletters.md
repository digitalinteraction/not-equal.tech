### Newsletter 2019

As we are approached the end of 2019, this first Not-Equal newsletter provided a summary of progress and activities the Network+ had achieved so far.

Through these ventures we began to explore the social justice dimension of technology design and; how, collectively, we can develop responses that can make our digital society work for everyone.

Not-Equal activities so far have included:

* Open Commissioning
* Not-Equal Summer School
* Open Events and Workshops
* Youth & Community Engagements 

This newsletter provides more details about these activities and future planned events.
