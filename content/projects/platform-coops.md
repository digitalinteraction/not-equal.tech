  text: 'The food delivery industry in the UK is big business, however, there remains
    a lack of employment law protections for many self-employed workers. This project
    aimed to develop an understanding of the challenges facing a food delivery platform
    co-operative and to co-design principles, strategies and systems to overcome these
    challenges. The project engaged in an initial literature review on food delivery
    platforms in order to understand why these workers were seeking a more ethical
    alternative. The team then reached out to new platform co-operatives in the sector,
    Through interviews, data on business operations was gathered from five UK based
    co-operatives: the Doorstep Collective in London, Chorlton Bike Deliveries, Manchester
    CoopCycle, the York Collective and Bristol CoopCycle.'

  text: 'The project produced the paper Delivering Rights: Alternatives in the Online
    Food Economy looking at food delivery co-operatives as alternatives to the current
    food delivery platform model. Problems with the existing platform system include
    tendency to monopoly, poor working conditions and inequality. An alternative path
    is tracked that integrates more equal outcomes. New infrastructure is proposed
    including rider service stations, rest and meeting zones and dedicated dispatch
    zones. A How to Launch a Food Co-operative guide was produced in collaboration
    with CoopCycle and Cooperatives UK. The team hope to work with these co-operatives
    to produce further studies with the help of local council grants.'
