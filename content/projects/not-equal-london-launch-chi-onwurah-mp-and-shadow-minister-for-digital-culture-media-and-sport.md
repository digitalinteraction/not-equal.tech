In Chi Onwurahâ€™s keynote, she talks about how often in the absence of ordinary people, we have tech talking only to tech leading to problems such as algorithmic bias and a widening gap of digital literacy. She explained we need this to change, and citizens need to be empowered to be in control their own data.

To achieve this, she said, we need to invest in people, places and infrastructure.
