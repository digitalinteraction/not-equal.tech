      Since COVID-19 broke out, Not-Equal has engaged with organisations across
      the UK to find out what challenges they were facing as they tried to
      continue to work with the communities they support. 


      In this session, we will present some of the insights gained through these conversations and our panelist will offer some ideas for ways we can work towards a democratisation of access to digital technologies and services that safeguards people and their needs. We will then open the floor for discussion.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many service providers and beneficiaries to use digital technology to access and deliver services, and maintain social relations. In some cases, the ‘switch’ to using digital technology to support communities has not been a smooth transition; in other cases, it has not been an option at all. Unsurprisingly, the pandemic brought back to the forefront long-standing inequities relating to digital access and inclusion in our societies.
