    text: The Design Fiction Toolkit helps developers to apply social justice
      principles during the Machine Learning development pipeline and to signal
      to researchers where further work is needed. It responds to the needs of
      product managers, developers, and data scientists of ML applications to
      mitigate bias. The intention is to develop the Toolkit further and adapt
      it to two use cases that emerged during the research â€“ in educational
      settings as part of an ethics awareness activity and in small digital
      teams within innovative start-ups interested in ethical design features.

This project aimed to tackle social injustice in future algorithmic-based decision-making applications by devising strategies to expose, counterbalance, and remedy bias and exclusion built into algorithms, considering fairness, transparency, and accountability. The project employed a design fiction approach to developing a toolkit in a collaborative workshop session with supporting materials to be used by stakeholders to experiment with scenarios to expose potential bias and reflect on mitigation strategies early in the design process.
