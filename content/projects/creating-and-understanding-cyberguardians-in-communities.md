    text: The CyberGuardians went on to disseminate cybersecurity information to
      around 820 people through peer-to-peer learning over the course of nine
      months.  When Covid-19 hit, the CyberGuardians moved online and helped
      many older citizens to stay safe during the phishing increase and gave
      advice on using Zoom securely so they could stay in touch with family and
      friends.

Older adults are targeted by internet scammers due to their lower digital literacy and limited computer support network. This project worked with 14 older adults to train them to share reliable cybersecurity information with their peers to help prevent opportunistic cyber-attacks. The CyberGuardians received training looking at different aspects of cybersecurity including live demonstrations of password hacking, and a phishing test. The topics focused on issues the group identified, such as password management, scam detection and protective software.
