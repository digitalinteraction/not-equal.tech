  text: Algorithms are increasingly being used in the delivery of public services.
    However, this has had some negative consequences, such as deepening some forms
    of discrimination, as well as raising concerns about surveillance. The project
    aimed to develop a blueprint for the socially responsible development of algorithms
    in public services. Data from 77 cases of public engagement from 2013-2020 was
    analyzed and public hopes and concerns about the use of data-driven services in
    the public sector were mapped.

    The project found that institutionally orchestrated and issue-focused forms of public engagement with the use of algorithms in public services are most influential in shaping governance, however, citizen-led forms of engagement are also emergent and need to be listened to. Concerns raised include issues around discrimination, privacy and consent.

    There is a need to continually monitor and learn from cases of public engagement with these approaches in order to ensure that they are developing in a socially responsible manner. The team is seeking funding to extend this pilot project in order to map public engagement with the use of algorithms in public services and to contribute to the responsible innovation of algorithms and related technologies.
