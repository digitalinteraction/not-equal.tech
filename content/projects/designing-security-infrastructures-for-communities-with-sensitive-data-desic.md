  text: 'For this project the research team explored notions of ‘positive digital
    security’ with two organizations focused on promoting empowerment and active citizenship
    for migrant women experiencing gender-based violence in the UK (Angelou Centre)
    and Greece (UWAH). They developed a low-fidelity web-based prototype to include
    both an administrator and client-based system for data management. The design
    was informed by three themes: information safekeeping and sharing, access to data
    and classification and communication.'

  text: The admin app consists of a form that maps the data each organization needs
    to have on each woman’s case. The client app allows each woman access to the data
    concerning her case. She can give access to to staff members and other organizations
    and also revoke access. The client app serves as communication between the organization
    and the women with an end-to-end encrypted chat functionality. The team believes
    it is important to further explore the interplay between offline and online harms
    in order to design technologies that can protect and support women to prevent
    potential harms from emerging.
