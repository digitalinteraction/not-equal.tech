  text: "  \nCivic participation and participatory design have historically been regarded
    as critical ways to tackle the power imbalance between ‘users’ and systems designers
    and developers. As part of Not-Equal's Open Commissioning process, citizens were
    invited to review the social impact of submitted research proposals to help determine
    which project should be funded.\n\nIn the first call the Community Panel were
    involved in the selection process to decide on the final funded projects. They
    were tasked with establishing a set of judging criteria based on their own experiences
    and perceptions of issues related to social justice in the digital economy. They
    decided research into social justice and innovation should consider and respond
    to the needs of a community; help to reduce barriers to participation and involvement
    in technology and services; and support community cohesion.\n\nThey provided a
    score for each criterion (out of 10) and a review statement for the proposals,
    based on reading the project title, tagline, and social impact statement. In the
    second call, the criteria already set out by the first panel was used to choose
    the projects. Members of the panel were matched to review projects based around
    their own experience and expertise. During the process, panelists found value
    in honest accounts that would openly consider the ambivalent nature that future
    digital innovations might entail. These insights add to the growing discourse
    about ethics in digital innovation and aligns with calls for design as a catalyst
    for social change."
