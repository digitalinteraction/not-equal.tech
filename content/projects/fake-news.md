  text: Today fake news spreads six times quicker than the truth and is believed 75%
    of the time, meaning it has the power to change behaviour and impact society.
    The projectâ€™s aim was to work with young people, social media influencers, teachers
    and academics to co-create materials to help young people to recognize fake news
    and to test these materials to ascertain their efficacy. The project recruited
    from three schools in Glasgow which drew a diverse group of young people.

  text: Around 18 young people, three teachers and five social media influencers were
    recruited to assist in the co-creation. Over six-weeks they worked to co-create
    the intervention which included a set of Powerpoint slides for teachers featuring
    videos and a range of interactive activities. Course content included how to recognize
    fake news stories and photographs, fake social media accounts, conspiracy theories
    and fake videos, discussing the impact all these could have on others.

    The intervention was trialed in three schools with around 420 young people aged 11-13 participating. Focus groups showed they found the intervention engaging and exciting and having completed it they felt better able to recognize fake news. Interviews with teachers showed they believed the intervention was engaging and fit well with the curriculum.

    The project team intends to work with Education Scotland, Higher Horizons and the National Teaching Forum to advertise the materials and work with parents to help them learn more about fake news. They write an article for TES magazine on [How schools can teach pupils to spot fake news.](https://www.tes.com/magazine/news/general/how-schools-can-teach-pupils-spot-fake-news)
