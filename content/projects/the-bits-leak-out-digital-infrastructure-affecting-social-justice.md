    text: Not-Equal is a 3 year UKRI funded project that aims to build sustainable
      networks of interest and foster new collaborations between researchers,
      communities and 35+ non-academic partners from industry, public and third
      sectors organisations. The goal of the Network+ is to resource
      transdisciplinary collaborations to develop practical responses to issues
      of justice in the design and application of technologies in the Digital
      Economy.

This event provided an opportunity for researchers interested in social justice and fairness affected by developments in Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Algorithmic Service Design, to discuss and shape the agenda of Not-Equalâ€”the new EPSRC Network+ on Social Justice through the Digital Economy.
