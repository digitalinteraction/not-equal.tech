21 PhD students and ECRs joined our second Not-Equal summer school, which took place in June 2021.

This year summer schools’ online format enabled us to develop an exciting programme of invited speakers and workshop leaders from all over the world. From unpacking digital commons to exploring the body as a site to explore social (in)justice in the digital economy, we went on a week-long journey into the evolution of social (in)justice in the age of machine learning and digital networks.

Alongside the daily sessions, our evening webinars were open to the public. These sessions ranged from a lively panel discussion on equitable digital economies to considering what the multifarious expressions of sheep (MEOS) can tell us about social justice.

We had over 500 people sign up to the webinars.

The Not-Equal Summer School

Speakers from a broad range of disciplines – worked with the cohort to explore different tools they could use in their social justice endeavours.

Over a week-long journey into the world of social justice and the digital economy, the cohort created microfictions around bodily gestures, took part in a Live Action Role Play about inter-species politics, and scrutinized the power relations and structures in their workplaces and collaborative research projects at our Solidarity Clinic.

The Summer School foregrounded dialogical spaces where speakers, workshop leaders and attendees shared their expertise, interests and experiences of doing social justice work in the digital economy.  This resulted in many different ideas and approaches discussed and developed in each workshop—from different responses and takes on SolarPunk in our Design Fiction session to exploring different ways to adapt strategies for building equity in collaborations according to domains and contexts.

It was amazing to see what attendees developed at each session —from redesigning an optimistic future using design fiction or exploring commoning as a way to consider alternative data economies.

The school was chaired by Clara Crivellaro, Newcastle University, and Ann Light, University of Sussex.
