The Future Generations Act (FGA) was implemented in 2015 with the aim to advance social, cultural, environmental and economic well-being through the public sector. This project explored the possibilities for advancing data justice in the context of the FGA. A scoping exercise was carried out to identify possible strategic areas at the intersection of the FGA and data justice, and a literature review of policy documents and academic publications was conducted. A virtual policy hacking workshop was organised to which over 40 people were invited.

The projectâ€™s research found that within the Future Generations (Wales) Act public procurement provides avenues for social value but this is not yet widely applied to digital procurement; data collection and sharing require more public dialogue and citizen involvement; there needs to be a distinction between token and meaningful public engagement.

Policy makers and professionals in the Welsh Government engaged well with the project. However, whilst there may be a will to advance data justice, there are historical and structural barriers in place. The research indicates a discrepancy between the vision of the Future Generations (Wales) Act and how it is being implemented in practice. Advancing real change in how data-driven technologies are understood, pursued, designed, implemented and used in the public sector requires structural and institutional reform.
