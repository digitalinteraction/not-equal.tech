  text: To grow food successfully, humans require the help of other organisms – for
    example bees, or soil micro-organisms. This project explored how we can use new
    technologies to help avoid problems such as soil degradation and bee extinction
    that threaten life on earth and looked at an algorithmic approach to creating
    a sustainable food justice system through co-designing blockchain futures with
    urban agricultural communities in London. A speculative participatory design (SPD)
    approach was used to explore futures grounded in the values, needs and challenges
    of real communities.

  text: The expertise of Furtherfield, a London-based arts organization who have developed
    an award-winning programme of engaging non-technical participants in blockchain
    futures, was drawn upon. The approach was interdisciplinary, drawing on methods
    from art and design, STS, and computer science. Activities included a multispecies
    Live Action Role Play (LARP), and paper prototyping of new blockchain-based systems.

  text: The methods and approach developed have been adopted by Furtherfield, as part
    of their programming and through their work on the EU-funded Creatures project.
    In this work they continue to engage with diverse citizens on issues of equality,
    participation, and ecology. Future activities include a paper for Big Data and
    Society and a book on More-than-human smart cities.
