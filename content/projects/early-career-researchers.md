There is a growing number of early career researchers (ECRs) and precariously employed postdoctoral researchers in academia, including multi- and inter-disciplinary researchers who do not fit traditional moulds and academic trajectories. The project invited interdisciplinary researchers working on topics related to digital social justice to an interview about their experiences of academia. Many participants referenced concerns about money, specifically pointing to financial instability making them feel anxious about their futures in academia and spoke of the challenges of working between disciplines and research streams. 

However, there were also several participants who were happy to be working between disciplines, despite any difficulties. A number of participants noted basic gaps in their PhD training. None of them felt they had ‘job security’, and while some felt optimistic about their careers, many did not and discussed the impact on their personal lives which was largely negative, noting the inability to plan for the future. 

Many participants spoke passionately about social justice, some felt let down by their departments’ lack of equivalent social justice values. The project will continue to seek funding opportunities to expand data collection, and develop new research and materials to support ECRs working in interdisciplinary, justice oriented digital technology research.
