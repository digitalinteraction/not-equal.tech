Over the 22-23rd September, the V & A hosted a Digital Design weekend to coincide with the London Design Festival. This included artists, engineers and technologists collaborating on a weekend of free workshops, talks and demonstrations to explore the intersection of technology and design.

Not-Equal was represented with a stand for drop in sessions which provided activities to explore everyday smart devices and technologies to help map the impact of smart technologies on issues of social justice. Attendees were able to share ideas and practices for building a DIY guide to digital self-protection using our storyboarding kits.

Listen to Not-Equal Director, Dr Clara Crivellaro discuss the ‘Ethics of Technology’ at the event on the [TECHnique podcast here.](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/episode-23-ethics-of-technology/id1123475818?i=1000420764593)
