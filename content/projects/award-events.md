**Award Events**

We have hosted two events to celebrate the launch of the 17 projects we have funded from the UKRI Not-Equal Network+ since 2018, exploring practical responses to help create the conditions for technologies to support social justice. These interactive events have showcased these funded projects where attendees can learn more about the projects.

**First award event**

The first award event took place in the Urban Sciences Building at Newcastle University and brought together the ten projects funded by the first Call for Collaborations. The ten projects were awarded over £270k to explore social justice in the digital economy with examples looking at addressing knife crime to using technology to improve food security.

Clara Crivellaro, lead investigator, Newcastle University explained: “The fast pace of digital innovation can raise social justice issues that range from fears around digital exclusion to concerns around how algorithmic bias can generate inequalities in public service provision. We are excited to fund these ten projects, which will look at ways to empower citizens and create innovative responses that help make our digital society work for everyone.”

**Second award event**

The second award event was held online and featured presentations from each of the seven new funded projects from the second Call for Collaborations.

Erinma Ochu, Interim Director of Engaging Environments, a NERC-funded initiative led out of the University of Reading, gave the keynote talk on Building Equity, Environmental Justice and Co-Enquiry Processes into Digital Technology Research. 

As well as presentations from the newly funded projects, attendees could join sessions to discuss ideas around; equitable digital futures; digital economy responses to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic; making digital economy research accountable; and our upcoming Not-Equal Summit event. 

Clara Crivellaro explained: “Never has there been a more important time to look at the implications and opportunities that digital technology can bring to social justice. From looking at how we can tackle the impact of fake news, to dealing with issues relating to COVID-19 – these seven projects will develop innovative responses to real issues in people’s daily lives,” said Clara Crivellaro, lead investigator, Newcastle University.”
