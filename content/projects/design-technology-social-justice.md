      Not-Equal’s call for collaboration process asks academics to partner with
      non-academic organisations, she explained how working closely with
      community partners can help researchers and designers really to understand
      the issues they are facing.


      She explains: “It’s not enough to just hear what the problems are, it’s about going in together and really trying to understand why the issues are the way they are.”


      Ann Light is a Professor of Design at The University of Sussex and Malmö University, she also discussed her upcoming book Designs to Reshape Humanity.
