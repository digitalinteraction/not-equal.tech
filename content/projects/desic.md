    text: The admin app consists of a form that maps the data each organization
      needs to have on each woman’s case. The client app allows each woman
      access to the data concerning her case. She can give access to to staff
      members and other organizations and also revoke access. The client app
      serves as communication between the organization and the women with an
      end-to-end encrypted chat functionality. The team believes it is important
      to further explore the interplay between offline and online harms in order
      to design technologies that can protect and support women to prevent
      potential harms from emerging.

For this project the research team explored notions of ‘positive digital security’ with two organizations focused on promoting empowerment and active citizenship for migrant women experiencing gender-based violence in the UK (Angelou Centre) and Greece (UWAH). They developed a low-fidelity web-based prototype to include both an administrator and client-based system for data management. The design was informed by three themes: information safekeeping and sharing, access to data and classification and communication.
