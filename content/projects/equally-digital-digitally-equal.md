  text: This project evaluated the current practices and methods of four NGOs from
    the UK and South America to develop new sharable and collaborative practices fit
    for the current global condition, given the shift in how communities are using
    technology since the Covid-19 pandemic.

  text: The team worked with four groups across Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, and UK
    sharing thoughts digitally and running online monthly discussions. Megaphones
    were created, designed by Espacio Nixso and built with poetry group Voices Heard
    in Leeds.

  text: 'The megaphones as a technology of communication limited the poets – they
    had to speak slower, louder and clearer, and hold them close to their mouths,
    thereby technology became rustrating rather than a facilitator. It was found that
    instead the shared narratives and practices that were paramount: personal interaction
    around how people were living, working, and surviving fed into our wider conversations
    around sustainability, bodies, tech, and health. The project secured a £75k British
    Council grant enabling live and remote creative collaborations with the group
    performing a poetry piece using the megaphones at an event hosted in Leeds and
    broadcast to the collaborators in Latin America.'
