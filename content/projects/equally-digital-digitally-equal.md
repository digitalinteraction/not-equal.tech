    text: The team worked with four groups across Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, and
      UK sharing thoughts digitally and running online monthly discussions.
      Megaphones were created, designed by Espacio Nixso and built with poetry
      group Voices Heard in Leeds.

    text: "The megaphones as a technology of communication limited the poets – they
      had to speak slower, louder and clearer, and hold them close to their
      mouths, thereby technology became rustrating rather than a facilitator. It
      was found that instead the shared narratives and practices that were
      paramount: personal interaction around how people were living, working,
      and surviving fed into our wider conversations around sustainability,
      bodies, tech, and health. The project secured a £75k British Council grant
      enabling live and remote creative collaborations with the group performing
      a poetry piece using the megaphones at an event hosted in Leeds and
      broadcast to the collaborators in Latin America."

This project evaluated the current practices and methods of four NGOs from the UK and South America to develop new sharable and collaborative practices fit for the current global condition, given the shift in how communities are using technology since the Covid-19 pandemic.
