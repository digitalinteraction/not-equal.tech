Current neoliberal economic models driving much digital innovation are exploitative and contribute to the reproduction and widening of inequalities. Can design help forge equitable economic models and reshape current value-systems? How?   

We can begin to repair these weaknesses, but we will need to pay more attention to the necessarily human and collaborative work-practices of data science, and we will need to re-think our technologies to preserve a more transparent and accountable provenance of human decisions and human outcomes that contribute to data science applications.

This webinar took place on Tuesday 8th June 2021.
