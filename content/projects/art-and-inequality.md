The project set out to address entrenched inequalities in the cultural sector and work towards social justice for workers in a precarious economy. The project ran a series of six research workshops entitled \_Assembly: A Forum for Artists in Precarious Labour\_ hosted by, and produced in collaboration with, Newbridge Project, an artist-led community centre. Around 50 participants attended the workshops. A key concern among participants was their lack of knowledge concerning key practical information, especially relating to employment law, rights, contracts, invoicing and other administrative activities associated with working as a freelancer in the digital cultural sector. The taboo of conversations around finances and working conditions was considered a major barrier to progression on issues of precarity within the sector and barriers to solidarity amongst workers in a sector dominated by freelancing, low pay and undercutting were outlined. This was considered a cultural phenomenon linked to long-standing assumptions regarding creativity and individualism. There are plans to host a physical resource hub with the Newbridge Project and the Star and Shadow Cinema and the establishment of the digital resource hub will follow.
