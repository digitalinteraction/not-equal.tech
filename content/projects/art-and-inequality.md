    text: A key concern among participants was their lack of knowledge concerning
      key practical information, especially relating to employment law, rights,
      contracts, invoicing and other administrative activities associated with
      working as a freelancer in the digital cultural sector.

    text: The taboo of conversations around finances and working conditions was
      considered a major barrier to progression on issues of precarity within
      the sector and barriers to solidarity amongst workers in a sector
      dominated by freelancing, low pay and undercutting were outlined. This was
      considered a cultural phenomenon linked to long-standing assumptions
      regarding creativity and individualism. There are plans to host a physical
      resource hub with the Newbridge Project and the Star and Shadow Cinema and
      the establishment of the digital resource hub will follow.

The project set out to address entrenched inequalities in the cultural sector and work towards social justice for workers in a precarious economy. The project ran a series of six research workshops entitled Assembly: A Forum for Artists in Precarious Labour hosted by, and produced in collaboration with, Newbridge Project, an artist-led community centre. Around 50 participants attended the workshops.
