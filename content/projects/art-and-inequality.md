      "The project set out to address entrenched inequalities in the cultural sector
      and work towards social justice for workers in a precarious economy. The project
      ran a series of six research workshops entitled _Assembly: A Forum for Artists
      in Precarious Labour_ hosted by, and produced in collaboration with, Newbridge
      Project, an artist-led community centre. Around 50 participants attended the workshops.
      A key concern among participants was their lack of knowledge concerning key practical
      information, especially relating to employment law, rights, contracts, invoicing
      and other administrative activities associated with working as a freelancer in
      the digital cultural sector. The taboo of conversations around finances and working
      conditions was considered a major barrier to progression on issues of precarity
      within the sector and barriers to solidarity amongst workers in a sector dominated
      by freelancing, low pay and undercutting were outlined. This was considered a
      cultural phenomenon linked to long-standing assumptions regarding creativity and
      individualism. There are plans to host a physical resource hub with the Newbridge
      Project and the Star and Shadow Cinema and the establishment of the digital resource
      hub will follow."
