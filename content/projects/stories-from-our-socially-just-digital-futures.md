Imagination and storytelling are the basis of all social transformations and social movements. They help us visualise, enact and share the kind of futures we wish to shape up together. What stories and what futures do we need to imagine now more than ever?   

Our keynote speaker, Carl Di Salvo (Georgia Tech) described the power of experimentation as a means of cultivating and sustaining imagination.

He was joined by director and playwright Sarah Naomi Lee and Sci Fi writer Al Robertson, who read a sci-fi story written to reflect thoughts and conversations heard during Not-Equal Summer webinars events.

This webinar took place Thursday 10th June, 2021.
