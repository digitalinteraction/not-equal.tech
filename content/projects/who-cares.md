    In the UK, women make up over half of gig workers but their experiences have been largely overlooked in public debates. The project aimed to identify challenges and opportunities for migrant and BAME women and other vulnerable groups using platforms in the gig economy.The project captured micro-stories – snapshots from workers’ lives – that illustrated some of the issues experienced and created visualisations to provide synthetic overviews of workers’ networks and analyze conversations in context. The project showed how the nature and extent of this digital labour is often hidden and deemed unproductive.

  text: Second, these online spaces encapsulate new bodies of knowledge on platform
    working and the changing nature of work. They also constitute an alternative source
    of rich text data. As a result of the project one of the partner organizations
    – New Economics Foundation is currently writing a policy paper on digital transformations
    in the UK care sector. The project has also been supporting the Nanny Solidarity
    Network and the IWGB Nannies & Au pairs branch to develop a union campaign demanding
    that workers are paid a minimum wage.
