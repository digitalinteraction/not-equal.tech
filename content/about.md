# About

Not-Equal is a UKRI funded network, NetworkPlus, that aims to foster new collaborations in order to create the conditions for digital technology to support social justice, and develop a path for inclusive digital innovation and a fairer future for all in and through the digital economy.

Over the last three years, the network has brought together researchers, communities and partners from industry, public and the third sector organizations, to explore and co-create practical responses to issues of fairness and justice in technology design and its use.

Not-Equal has offered NetworkPlus partners a variety of funding opportunities to explore and stimulate ideas, as well as supporting the commissioning of innovative research that directly addresses and encourage social justice in our digital society.
