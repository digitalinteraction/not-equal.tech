# About

Not-Equal, the EPSRC Network+ on Social Justice through the Digital Economy was a three-year project led by Newcastle University, in collaboration with Royal Holloway University of London, the University of Sussex and Swansea University. 

It aimed to bring together and resource collaborations between academia, industry, government and civil society to explore and respond to issues of social justice in technology design and the potential for technologies to make socio-economic life in the UK fairer.   

Not-Equal has offered NetworkPlus partners a variety of funding opportunities to explore and stimulate ideas, as well as supporting the commissioning of innovative research that directly addresses and encourage social justice in our digital society.\
